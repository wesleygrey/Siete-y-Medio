# Siete-y-Medio
Simulates the Spanish card game 'siete y medio' with the computer as the dealer.

"The traditional Spanish baraja is an old deck that was brought over by the Moors to Spain during the 14th century. The cards are still called naipes after the nƒÅ'ib cards found in the Mamluk deck... 

Smaller decks have 40 cards and lack ranks 8, 9 and comodines (jokers). The four suits are bastos (clubs), oros (literally "golds", that is, golden coins), copas (cups) and espadas (swords). The four suits are thought to represent the four social classes of the Middle Ages. The suit of coins represents the merchants, the clubs represents the peasants, the cups represent the church and the swords represent the military.

The three face cards of each suit have pictures similar to the jack, queen, and king in the French deck, and rank identically. They are the sota, which is similar to the jack/knave and generally depicts a page or squire, the caballo (knight, literally "horse"), and the rey (king) respectively."

The non-face cards' value is simply their respective rank. The face cards all take the value of 1/2.

At each round of play the player places a bet. After that, the player and the dealer each draw one card from the deck.The player is then repeatedly asked if another card is wanted. The player can continue to draw cards while the total is less than 71/2. After the player's turn is over, the dealer's cards are shown. The dealer's play is always the same: the dealer continues to draw cards only if the total is less than 51/2.
